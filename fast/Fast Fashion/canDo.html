               <h2>Donate clothing to local organizations.</h2>
                    <p>Donating clothes to developing countries often disrupts local markets. For instance, rather than purchasing a pair of shoes from a local vendor for $7, consumers in these countries may buy secondhand shoes that have been shipped from the United States for $3. As a result, local vendors may lower their prices in order to make the sales necessary to support optimal living conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>Upon placing your donation into a bin hanging around a nearby parking lot, it becomes difficult to track where your donation ends up. In order to get rid of unwanted clothing and to ensure that use comes out of items that you have paid good money for, donating to local organizations like a women's home, an adult daycare center, or a non-profit thrift shop ensures that someone in need of clothing receives your donation or that the money earned from its resale is donated. Your old suit may continue its life in someone else's closet without any unforeseen harm done.
                    </p>
                    <p>Rosie's Place and Dress for Success are two non-profits in the Boston area that put donations into direct use.
                    </p>
                    <p>Boomerangs, operated by the AIDS Action Committee, and Goodwill Stores both donate portions of their proceeds.

               <h2>Buy and sell secondhand clothing.</h2>
                            <p>From the comfort of you own home, sites including Poshmark, ThredUp, and Depop can connect you with lightly worn and mint condition items that have been sitting unworn in closets around the country. Selling your old clothing is also an excellent side hustle option.</p>

                  <h2>Try a capsule wardrobe. </h2>
                            <p id="closetText">
                                <p>Creating a capsule with basics that you already creates a functional foundation that encourages you to wear pieces more often and more creatively. Perhaps, layering a sweater over a button-down shirt or pairing that same sweater with a skirt are two outfits that you never would have thought up before. Working from fewer pieces may leave you less overwhelmed with quantity and more focused on getting more wear out of less.</p>
                            </p>
                            <h4>Test out this capsule concept down below.</h4>
